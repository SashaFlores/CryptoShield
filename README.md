# CryptoShield

## **Source of Our Inspiration**

*The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies and the absence of robust government regulations to safeguard individuals' hard-earned money from scams, rug pulls, and unreliable entities have constrained the widespread acceptance of digital currencies. As a result, their global adoption remains limited.* 

*The unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets, coupled with the absence of legal frameworks to hold fraudulent actors accountable, has created an environment where investors face significant risks. Consequently, individuals and businesses alike hesitate to fully embrace digital coins as a reliable medium of exchange and store of value. The lack of credibility and investor protection acts as a barrier, hindering the broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies on a global scale.*
